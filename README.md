# JS-Todo-App
This Todo App was built using Webpack technologies using:
* Html/CSS
* JavaScript
# External Libraries
* Uuid - https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid [Public]
Uuid is used to give tasks in both LocalStorage & Memory an identity so they can be saved and altered.  


The Aim of this project is to allow users to interface with a Todo style API whilst using *localStorage* to save their items to local browser memory.
