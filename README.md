# JS-Todo-App
This Todo App was built using Webpack technologies using:
* Html/CSS
* JavaScript
# External Libraries
* Uuid - https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid [Public]

Uuid is used to give tasks in both LocalStorage & Memory an identity so they can be saved and altered.  

# Features
* LocalStorage - You can store objects and they will save on the local browser memory
* Task Edits - Once a task is create it can be changed or deleted
* Dates - Tasks are dated and thus the app shows if they are overdue or not
* Projects - A folder like directory for Tasks with a specific meaning

# Link
The Aim of this project is to allow users to interface with a Todo style API whilst using *localStorage* to save their items to local browser memory.
